# What is this?
My solutions to the [Kotlin Koans](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans/), 
a series of exercises to help learn Kotlin syntax.

All of the tests pass: that doesn't mean my solutions are correct or idiomatic
though!

# How do I build?

## Command-line

    $ ./gradlew test

## Android Studio 3.0

1. Import project from Gradle 
2. Create a Run configuration with the Gradle task `test`
3. Run it.
